Introduction to Machine Learning
            Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that involves teaching machines to learn patterns and make decisions based on data.
Types of Machine Learning
1.	Supervised Learning

•	Definition: The model is trained on labeled data, where the input-output relationship is known
•	Goal: Predict the output (target variable) for new, unseen inputs.
•	Examples:
o	Classification (e.g., email spam detection).
o	Regression (e.g., predicting house prices).
2. Unsupervised Learning
•	Definition: The model is trained on unlabeled data, identifying patterns, clusters, or structure in the data.
•	Goal: Explore data and discover underlying relationships without predefined labels.
•	Examples:
o	Clustering (e.g., customer segmentation).
o	Dimensionality reduction (e.g., reducing features for visualization).
3. Reinforcement Learning
•	Definition: The model learns through trial and error, receiving rewards or penalties for actions to achieve a specific objective.
•	Goal: Develop a policy that maximizes cumulative rewards in a dynamic environment.
•	Examples:
o	Game playing (e.g., AlphaGo).
o	Robotics (e.g., teaching a robot to walk).
