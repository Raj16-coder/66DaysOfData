Python for Machine Learning – Essential Libraries

1. Pandas
Purpose: Data manipulation and analysis.
Key Features:
•	Read/write data from various formats (CSV, Excel, JSON, SQL, etc.).
•	Handle missing data effectively.
•	Perform filtering, grouping, and aggregation.
•	Manipulate time-series data.

2. NumPy
Purpose: Numerical computation.
•	Key Features:
o	Perform vectorized operations (e.g., element-wise addition, multiplication).
o	Support for linear algebra, random number generation, and Fourier transforms.
o	Basis for many ML libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch.
3. Matplotlib
Purpose: Data visualization.
•	Key Features:
o	Create a wide range of plots (line, scatter, bar, histogram, etc.).
o	Customize every aspect of the plot (labels, legends, colors, etc.).
o	Integrate seamlessly with other libraries like Pandas.
