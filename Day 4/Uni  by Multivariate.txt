 What I learned:
1️⃣ Univariate Analysis: Examining one variable at a time (e.g., histograms, box plots).
2️⃣ Bivariate Analysis: Analyzing the relationship between two variables (e.g., scatter plots, correlation).
3️⃣ Multivariate Analysis: Studying the relationships among three or more variables (e.g., pair plots, heatmaps).
