Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Handling Missing Data and Duplicates

1. Handling Missing Data
Missing data can arise from various reasons, such as data entry errors, sensor failures, or incomplete records. 
Methods to Handle Missing Data
(a) Removing Missing Data
•	When to use:
o	If the number of missing values is small compared to the dataset size.
o	When the missing values do not carry significant information.
(b) Imputing Missing Values
•	When to use:
o	If the dataset has a significant amount of missing data.
o	When missing values can be estimated based on other data.
•	
Techniques:
•	Mean/Median/Mode Imputation:
o	Replace missing values with the mean (for numerical), median, or mode (for categorical).
2. Handling Duplicates
Duplicates occur when the same data point appears more than once in the dataset. 
Removing Duplicates
•	When to use:
o	If duplicates are genuinely redundant and do not add value to the analysis.
